At night the passion came,\nLike the fierce fiend of a distempered dream,\nAnd shook him from his rest, and led him forth\nInto the darkness.—As an eagle, grasped\nIn folds of the green serpent, feels her breast\nBurn with the poison, and precipitates\nThrough night and day, tempest, and calm, and cloud,\nFrantic with dizzying anguish, her blind flight\nO'er the wide airy wilderness: thus driven\nBy the bright shadow of that lovely dream,\nBeneath the cold glare of the desolate night,\nThrough tangled swamps and deep precipitous dells,\nStartling with careless step the moonlight snake,\nHe fled. Red morning dawned upon his flight,\nShedding the mockery of its vital hues\nUpon his cheek of death. He wandered on\nTill vast Aornos\nOf putrid marshes. A strong impulse urged\nHis steps to the sea-shore. A swan was there,\nBeside a sluggish stream among the reeds.\nIt rose as he approached, and, with strong wings\nScaling the upward sky, bent its bright course\nHigh over the immeasurable main.\nHis eyes pursued its flight:—‘Thou hast a home,\nBeautiful bird; thou voyagest to thine home,\nWhere thy sweet mate will twine her downy neck\nWith thine, and welcome thy return with eyes\nBright in the lustre of their own fond joy.\nAnd what am I that I should linger here,",

    "text": "The Poem which I now present to the world is an attempt from which I\nscarcely dare to expect success, and in which a writer of established\nfame might fail without disgrace. It is an experiment on the temper of\nthe public mind, as to how far a thirst for a happier condition of\nmoral and political society survives, among the enlightened and\nrefined, the tempests which have shaken the age in which we live. I\nhave sought to enlist the harmony of metrical language, the ethereal\ncombinations of the fancy, the rapid and subtle transitions of human\npassion, all those elements which essentially compose a Poem, in the\ncause of a liberal and comprehensive morality; and in the view of\nkindling within the bosoms of my readers a virtuous enthusiasm for\nthose doctrines of liberty and justice, that faith and hope in\nsomething good, which neither violence nor misrepresentation nor\nprejudice can ever totally extinguish among mankind.\n\nFor this purpose I have chosen a story of human passion in its most\nuniversal character, diversified with moving and romantic adventures,\nand appealing, in contempt of all artificial opinions or institutions,\nto the common sympathies of every human breast. I have made no attempt\nto recommend the motives which I would substitute for those at present\ngoverning mankind, by methodical and systematic argument. I would only\nawaken the feelings, so that the reader should see the beauty\nI do not presume to enter into competition with our greatest contemporary Poets.\nYet I am unwilling to tread in the footsteps of any who have preceded me.\nI have sought to avoid the imitation of any style of language or versification peculiar to the original minds of which it is the character;\ndesigning that, even if what I have produced be worthless, it should still be properly my own.",

O, from sleep\nMost vainly must my weary brain implore\nIts long lost flattery now: I wake to weep,\nAnd sit through the long day gnawing the core\nOf my bitter heart, and, like a miser, keep,\nSince none in what I feel take pain or pleasure,\nTo my own soul its self-consuming treasure.’\n\nHe dwelt beside me near the sea;\nAnd oft in evening did we meet,\nWhen the waves, beneath the starlight, flee\nO’er the yellow sands with silver feet,\nAnd talked: our talk was sad and sweet,\nTill slowly from his mien there passed\nThe desolation which it spoke;\nAnd smiles,—as when the lightning’s blast\nHas parched some heaven-delighting oak,\nThe next spring shows leaves pale and rare,\nBut like flowers delicate and fair,\nOn its rent boughs,—again arrayed\nHis countenance in tender light:\nHis pointed eyelashes between,\nWould gather in the light serene\nOf smiles, whose lustre bright and soft\nBeneath lay undulating there.",

Farewell!\n\nFrom all the blasts of heaven thou hast descended:\nYes, like a spirit, like a thought, which makes\nUnwonted tears throng to the horny eyes,\nAnd beatings haunt the desolated heart,\nWhich should have learnt repose: thou hast descended\nCradled in tempests; thou dost wake, O Spring!\nO child of many winds! As suddenly\nThou comest as the memory of a dream,\nWhich now is sad because it hath been sweet;\nLike genius, or like joy which riseth up\nAs from the earth, clothing with golden clouds\nThe desert of our life.\nThis is the season, this the day, the hour;\nAt sunrise thou shouldst come, sweet sister mine,\nToo long desired, too long delaying, come!\nHow like death-worms the wingless moments crawl!\nThe point of one\nLift up thine eyes,\nAnd let me read thy dream.\nWith our sea-sister at his feet I slept.\nThe mountain mists, condensing at our voice\nUnder the moon, had spread their snowy flakes,\nFrom the keen ice shielding our linked sleep.\nThen two dreams came. One, I remember not.\nBut in the other his pale wound-worn limbs\nFell from Prometheus, and the azure night\nGrew radiant with the glory of that form\nWhich lives unchanged within, and his voice fell",

When lofty thought\nLifts a young heart above its mortal lair,\nAnd love and life contend in it, for what\nShall be its earthly doom, the dead live there\nAnd move like winds of light on dark and stormy air.\n\nThe inheritors of unfulfilled renown\nRose from their thrones, built beyond mortal thought,\nFar in the Unapparent. Chatterton\nRose pale,—his solemn agony had not\nYet faded from him; Sidney, as he fought\nAnd as he fell and as he lived and loved\nSublimely mild, a Spirit without spot,\nArose; and Lucan, by his death approved:\nOblivion as they rose shrank like a thing reproved.",
